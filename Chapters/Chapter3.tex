\chapter{Refined scope}

While standard XAI focuses on feature
attribution in classifiers, the ``features''
in formal languages are sequential and
structural.
%
Since the confirmation report, the
research scope has been refined to
address three primary gaps:

\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item \textbf{Research Problem 1 (Completed): Explaining Finite Automata.} 

    How can we provide Formal Explanations 
    for Finite Automata decisions?
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        %
        \item To Define Formal explanations for
        understanding the acceptance/rejection of
        inputs in Finite Automata
        %
        \item To develop a method to compute
        Formal Explanations for Finite Automata
        %
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \item \textbf{Research Problem 2: Explaining Context-Free Grammar (CFG).}
    
    How can we provide Formal Explanations
    for CFG decisions?
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        %
        \item To Define Formal explanations for
        understanding the recognition of
        inputs by CFGs.
        %
        \item To develop a method to compute
        Formal Explanations for CFGs.
        %
        \item To propose a method to identify
        the most significant or ``most likely''
        explanations.
        %
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \item \textbf{Research Problem 3: Explaining Decisions of Stochastic models.} 
    
    How can we provide formal explanations for decisions made by stochastic models?
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        %
        \item To Define Formal explanations for understanding
        probable outcomes in Stochastic Models.
        %
        \item To develop a method to compute Formal Explanations
        for Stochastic Models
        (e.g., Probabilistic Finite Automata or Markov Models).
        %
        \item To propose a method to identify
        the most significant or ``most likely''
        explanations among probabilistic paths.
        %
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions - achieved and projected}

This research provides both theoretical and practical
contributions:

\emph{Achieved Contributions}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of a theoretical and practical approach
    to explain Finite Automata.
    \item A paper submitted to ICALP 2026 titled
    ``A Formal Framework for the Explanation of Finite Automata Decisions''
\end{itemize}

\emph{Projected Contributions}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explaining Context-Free Grammar: (In Progress)
    Extending the formal explanation framework to CFGs,
    which recognise Context-Free Languages.
    %
    This involves developing algorithms to identify the
    minimal contrastive explanations (CXps)
    and Abductive Explanations (AXps),
    and quantifying the contribution
    of specific tokens to the decision (acceptance or rejection).
    %
    \item Explaining Decisions of Stochastic models:
    Extending the formal explanation framework to Stochastic Models.
    %
    The goal is to provide verifiable explanations able to
    identify the environmental factors
    or decision points that lead to a particular outcome.
\end{itemize}
