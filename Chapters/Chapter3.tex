\chapter{Refined scope}

While standard XAI focuses on feature
attribution in classifiers, the ``features''
in formal languages are sequential and
structural.
%
Since the confirmation report, the
research scope has been refined to
address three primary gaps:

\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item \textbf{Research Problem 1 (Completed): Explaining Finite Automata.} 
    How can we provide Formal Explanations 
    for Finite Automata decisions?
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        %
        \item To Define Formal explanations for
        understanding the acceptance/rejection of
        inputs in Finite Automata
        %
        \item To develop a method to compute
        Formal Explanations for Finite Automata
        %
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \item \textbf{Research Problem 2: Explaining Pushdown Automata (PDA).}
    %
    How can we provide Formal Explanations
    for Pushdown Automata decisions?
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        %
        \item To Define Formal explanations for
        understanding the acceptance/rejection of
        inputs in Pushdown Automata.
        %
        \item To develop a method to compute
        Formal Explanations for Pushdown Automata.
        %
        \item To propose a method to identify
        the most significant or ``most likely''
        explanations among explanations.
        %
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \item \textbf{Research Problem 3: Explaining Decisions of Stochastic models.} 
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        %
        \item To Define Formal explanations for understanding
        the probable outcomes in Stochastic Models.
        %
        \item To develop a method to compute Formal Explanations
        for Stochastic Models
        (e.g., Probabilistic Finite Automata or Markov Models).
        %
        \item To propose a method to identify
        the most significant or ``most likely''
        explanations among probabilistic paths.
        %
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Contributions - achieved and projected }

This research provides both theoretical and practical
contributions:

\emph{Achieved Contributions}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of a theoretical and practical approach
    to explain Finite Automata.
    \item A paper submitted to ICALP 2026 tittled
    ``A Formal Framework for the Explanation of Finite Automata Decisions''
\end{itemize}

\emph{Projected Contributions}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explaining Pushdown Automata decisions: (In Progress)
    Extending the formal explanation framework to PDAs,
    which recognize context-free languages.
    %
    This involves developing algorithms to identify the
    minimal contrastive explanations (CXps)
    and Abductive Explanations (AXps),
    and quantifying the contribution
    of specific tokens to the decision (acceptance or rejection).
    %
    \item Explaining Decisions of Stochastic models:
    Extending the formal explanation framework to Stochastic Models.
    %
    The goal is to provide verifiable explanations able to
    identify the environmental factors
    or decision points that lead to a particular outcomes.
\end{itemize}
